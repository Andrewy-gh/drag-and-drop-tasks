## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React framework, `styled-components` library, `react-beautiful-dnd` library.

This library uses the `react-beautiful-dnd` which allows the dragging and dropping of elements. Just a simple kanban board to test out the functionality of the library. `styled-components` were used to style some elements, but overall CSS was kept very minimal.

## Optimizations

In future, a form could be added to allow new tasks to be added to the board. The board could be easily adapted into other projects as well.
